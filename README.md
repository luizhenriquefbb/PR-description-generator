# Create PR with Automatically Generated Description

**Note: This project was created for study purposes.**

This script automates the process of creating a pull request (PR) on GitHub with a title and description generated by the Gemini AI model. It analyzes the changes between two git branches, uses Gemini to create a concise title and a detailed description, and then uses the GitHub CLI to create the PR.

## Prerequisites

1.  Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  Install the GitHub CLI. You can install the GitHub CLI from [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/).
3.  Add the Gemini API key to the `.env` file as `LLM_KEY`. You can obtain a Gemini API key from [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key as `LLM_KEY`.
3.  Install the dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4.  Authenticate with GitHub CLI using the command `gh auth login`.
5.  Run the script using the command `python create_pr.py --base_branch <base_branch> --current_branch <current_branch> --title "<optional title>"`. To run the script in interactive mode, use the command `python create_pr.py --interactive`.
6.  The script will then generate a title and description for the PR using the Gemini AI model and create the PR.
